                            <li>Make the Dough :
                                <ul>
                                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.</li>
                                    <li>Add the egg, sour cream, and softened butter to the flour mixture.</li>
                                    <li>Mix everything together until a dough forms. You may need to use your hands to knead the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>

                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                    <li>Season the filling mixture with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Assemble the Pierogi :
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Roll out the chilled dough on a floured surface to about 1/8 inch thickness.</li>
                                    <li>Use a round cookie cutter or a drinking glass to cut out circles of dough.</li>
                                    <li>Place a small spoonful of filling in the center of each dough circle.</li>
                                    <li>Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape.</li>
                                    <li>Press the edges firmly together to seal the pierogi. You can crimp the edges with a fork for a decorative touch.</li>

                            </li>
                            <li>Cook the Pierogi :
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
                                    <li>Carefully drop the pierogi into the boiling water, a few at a time, making sure not to overcrowd the pot.</li>
                                    <li>Cook the pierogi for about 3-5 minutes, or until they float to the surface.</li>
                                    <li>Remove the cooked pierogi with a slotted spoon and transfer them to a plate.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>You can serve the pierogi as is, or for a delicious twist, saut√© them in butter until they are lightly browned and crispy.</li>
                                    <li>Serve hot with sour cream, chopped green onions, or your favorite sauce.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
